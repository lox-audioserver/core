/**
 * Fans zone-state changes out to the public API without giving the API its own
 * source of truth.
 *
 * `notifyZoneStateChanged` is the one internal signal that a zone changed, and
 * the Loxone adapter is currently its only consumer. Rather than have the API
 * poll (or tap the Loxone connection registry, which would bind the public
 * contract to Loxone's frame format), this decorator sits in front of the real
 * notifier: the wrapped notifier keeps behaving exactly as before, and the hub
 * additionally receives the projected public payload.
 *
 * It is a decorator and not a second call site so that no future emit path can
 * forget to publish — anything that notifies Loxone notifies the API.
